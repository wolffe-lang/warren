# Grid slice directive

This local follow-on starts from parser head `d966f49`. It is kept separate
from the parser-only review while that head's Linux record is running.

## Prediction before code

1. Add the pure pane and screen shapes in `src/vt/grid.lu`. A screen uses a
   flat cell array plus per-row extents and wrap flags; each cell holds a base,
   two combining marks, width, rendition flags, foreground and background.
   Colours retain their set form: default, palette index, or tagged RGB.
2. Commit a constructor seam and failing rectangular-grid rows first. Expect
   the empty-array seam to fail `grid-rectangular`; then allocate independent
   primary and alternate screens, blank cells, default tabs and the whole
   scroll region. The one-row case must use region `1–1`.
3. Add printing and C0 rows red first: deferred wrap, CR/BS/LF/HT, scrolling a
   one-row screen and extent changes. Only ASCII is claimed at this step;
   the width table, pair repair and combining marks follow explicitly.
4. Add cursor/erase and rendition rows, then modes and saved cursor, followed
   by the alternate screen. Run the eight full oracle cases once the dump
   boundary exists; until then the rows inspect screen state directly.
5. Complete widths, resize/reflow and history only with their invariant and
   resource rows. No Unicode approximation is presented as the final table.

The provisional 64-byte-cell prediction in the main note remains the budget.
The initial seven-integer cell is 56 bytes of native scalar payload before
container overhead. At 80×24 the two screens should therefore be near 220 KiB,
not including parser state or history; the implementation's ledger, not this
arithmetic, supplies the measurement.
